# LeetCall

No operators, no conditions, no loops this time, function call is all you need!

## Rules:
1. Just like most of the online judges, inputs are provided from the standard input.
2. All you can use in your code is: (function) name (e.g. `print`), function call (e.g. `str()`), constants (int, float, byte, normal string etc.).
3. Your code should contain only one expression (i.e. it can be used in `eval`).
4. You are unable to use `exec`, `eval`, `import` or similar things to cheat.
5. If there are something you don't understand, the source code is provided -- so just read it.
6. Conquer all the 3 challenges and capture the FLAG!

## Notes:
1. For programmers: You are not required to read the source code.
2. For hackers: This is totally not a sandbox escape challenge, but feel free if you really want to hack it.
